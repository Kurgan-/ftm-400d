How to test:

take a memory dump from the radio containing all of the possible channel spacings.

export it to XML and check XML for errors compared to what is in radio memories

   ../ftm-export MEMFTM400D.dat  > test.xml

then import the XML (without modifications) to a new dat file

   ../ftm-import test.xml MEMFTM400D.dat MEM-OUT.dat 

then export the new dat file to another xml file.

   ../ftm-export MEM-OUT.dat  > test-out.xml

then make a diff of the xml files: they must NOT differ.

   diff test.xml  test-out.xml
